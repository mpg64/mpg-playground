# MPG Playground

This sacred grove serves as my personal testing ground for GitHub workflows and AI agent development work - a place where the ancient wisdom of technology meets the modern arts of automation.

## Purpose

- **GitHub Testing**: Experimenting with GitHub features, workflows, and integrations
- **AI Agent Development**: Testing and prototyping AI agent capabilities and implementations
- **Learning & Experimentation**: A safe space to try new technologies and approaches

## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains various experiments, prototypes, and test implementations related to:
- GitHub Actions and workflows
- AI agent frameworks and tools
- Development automation
- Integration testing

## Note

This is a personal playground repository - expect to see experimental code, work-in-progress features, and occasional cleanup as I iterate on different approaches.

*Feel free to explore these digital woods, young seeker, but keep in mind this is primarily for learning and experimentation purposes.*
